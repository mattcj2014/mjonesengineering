  <!-- ===== Overview ===== -->
  <section class="section-spacing">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project involved the complete design and construction of a custom CNC
      router intended for woodworking applications. The goal was to achieve a rigid,
      accurate machine using a mix of aluminum extrusion, custom plates, and
      integrated electronics.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== CAD Design ===== -->
  <section class="section-spacing">
    <h2>CAD Design</h2>
    <p>
      The machine was fully modeled in CAD prior to fabrication, allowing for
      interference checks, motion verification, and plate optimization.
    </p>

  <!-- ===== Physical Build ===== -->
  <section class="section-spacing">
    <h2>Physical Build</h2>
    <p>
      The final machine closely follows the CAD model, with adjustments made during
      assembly to improve rigidity, cable management, and serviceability.

  <!-- ===== Electronics ===== -->
  <section class="section-spacing">
    <h2>Electronics and Control</h2>
    <p>
      The router uses a GRBL based controller with external stepper drivers, limit
      switches, and an enclosed electronics box for safety and reliability.

    <h2>Machine in Operation</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a short video demonstrating machine motion and cutting performance.

  <!-- ===== Results ===== -->
  <section class="section-spacing">
    <h2>Results and Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>
      The completed machine achieved reliable and repeatable cuts in hardwoods.
      Through this build, I gained hands-on experience balancing rigidity, cost,
      and manufacturability in a real CNC system.
