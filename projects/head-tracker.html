    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Custom-built head tracking module for an FPV RC car, fully 3D printed
      and programmed using Arduino. The module translates head movements into
      camera orientation commands for immersive remote driving experiences.

    <h2>Design and Fabrication</h2>
    <p>
      The enclosure, mount, and mechanical parts were designed in CAD and
      3D printed for precise fit. Electronics integration included an MPU6050
      IMU and signal interfacing to override potentiometer channels for
      control of the car’s servo mechanisms.

    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      A key challenge was minimizing sensor drift and ensuring smooth tracking.
      This was overcome using filtered PWM signals, calibration routines, and
      software corrections to maintain accurate alignment between the head
      motion and the FPV camera orientation.
