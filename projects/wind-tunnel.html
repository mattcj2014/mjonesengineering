    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project involved the design and construction of a desktop scale wind
      tunnel to study airflow behavior and compare airfoil geometries.
      The system was developed as part of a university engineering course
      focused on experimental analysis and fluid behavior.

    <h2>Design and Fabrication</h2>
    <p>
      The wind tunnel structure and test section were designed for additive
      manufacturing and fabricated using a 3D printer.
      The modular design allowed for rapid iteration and easy swapping of
      airfoil test samples.
    </p>

    <p>
      Multiple airfoil shapes were modeled and printed to evaluate differences
      in flow attachment, separation, and wake behavior under the same flow
      conditions.

    <h2>Smoke Flow Visualization</h2>
    <p>
      To visualize airflow, a custom smoke generation system was designed and
      integrated upstream of the test section.
      The smoke system produced a consistent flow of visible tracer particles,
      allowing qualitative observation of streamlines and boundary layer
      behavior around each airfoil.

    <h2>Testing and Results</h2>
    <p>
      Airfoil performance was evaluated by observing flow patterns at different
      angles of attack.
      The setup made it possible to directly compare how geometry influenced
      flow separation and stability.

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>
      This project provided hands on experience with experimental setup,
      rapid prototyping, and qualitative aerodynamic analysis.
      It reinforced the relationship between theoretical fluid concepts and
      real world flow behavior.
